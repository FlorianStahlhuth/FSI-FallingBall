# FSI-FallingBall
We consider a falling elastic ball in a Newtonian fluid and model its movement via a variational monolithic formulation in the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Framework. To construct the ALE mapping, we utilize a harmonic mesh motion PDE with control parameter. The implementation is realized with the finite element library deal.II.
